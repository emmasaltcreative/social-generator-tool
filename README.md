# Salt Creative Content Generator

This repository contains a simple tool for generating content from a list of hooks.

## Running the Tool

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. The application runs completely client-side.

## CSV Requirements

* The CSV file should contain **one column** with your hooks.
* A header row is optional. If present, the header should be in the first row.
* The file must be saved using **UTF-8 encoding**.

## Google API Key

Live AI generation requires a Google API key. Set your key inside `index.html` by replacing the placeholder value of `apiKey` near the top of the script.
